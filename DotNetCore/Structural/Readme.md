#Structural
These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces. Structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.

##Adapter
Match interfaces of different classes
##Bridge
Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
##Composite
A tree structure of simple and composite objects
##Decorator
Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
Facade
A single class that represents an entire subsystem
##Flyweight
A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
##Private Class Data
Restricts accessor/mutator access
##Proxy
An object representing another object
