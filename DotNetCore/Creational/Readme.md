#Creational
These design patterns are all about class instantiation. This pattern can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns. While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation effectively to get the job done.

##Abstract Factory
Creates an instance of several families of classes
##Builder
Separates object construction from its representation
##Factory Method
Creates an instance of several derived classes
Object Pool
Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
##Prototype
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
##Singleton
A class of which only a single instance can exist
